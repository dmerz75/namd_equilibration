psfgen_package
by: Dale R. Merz Jr.

Goal: to correctly generate psf and pdb files for equilibration, in any
      solvent (vacuum, implicit, explicit).

Directions:
 1. name the pdb file accordingly, i.e. 00.pdb (see noh.pgn)
 2. Generate the protein structure with no hydrogens.
    On the command line, enter:
    >>> vmd -dispdev text -e noh.pgn > noh.log
 3. Generate the psf (protein structure file).
    On the command line, enter:
    >>> vmd -dispdev text -e psf.pgn > psf.log
 4. Start vmd.
    >>> vmd
