psfgen_package
by: Dale R. Merz Jr.

Goal: to correctly generate psf and pdb files for equilibration, in any
      solvent (vacuum, implicit, explicit).

Directions:
 1. name the pdb file accordingly, i.e. 00.pdb (see noh.pgn)
 2. Generate the protein structure with no hydrogens.
    On the command line, enter:
    >>> vmd -dispdev text -e noh.pgn > noh.log
 3. Generate the psf (protein structure file).
    On the command line, enter:
    >>> vmd -dispdev text -e psf.pgn > psf.log
 4. Start vmd.
    >>> vmd
    Open the TK Console window from the VMD Main -> Extensions -> TK Console.
    On the VMD TkConsole, enter:
    % source solvate.pgn
    % source ionize.pgn
    % exit
    Change the executed commands section. Identify 1st and last CA's.    
    >>> vmd -psf ionized.psf -pdb ionized.pdb
    % source load_rotate_origin_cminmax.tcl

Results:
 You should have:
    1. start.pdb, start.psf ready for equilibration.
       hold.ref, hold_ca.ref
